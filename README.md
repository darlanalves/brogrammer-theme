# NOTE

Fork of the Brogrammer theme mixed with the awesome [Seti_UI](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui)
theme made for Atom and [ported to ST3](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3).

## Changes

- Added bigger tab icons for changed files (make it easier to notice)
- Added the sidebar icons by file type (from Seti_UI theme).

To disable the sidebar icons, use these settings:

```
{
	"Brogrammer_sb_no_icons": true,
	"Brogrammer_sb_blank": true
}
```
